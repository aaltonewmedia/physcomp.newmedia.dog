*Apology Jacket* is a wearable system that automatically apologizes whenever someone bumps into you. 

Handmade pressure sensors sewn into each shoulder detect collisions, and measure the intensity of the impact. The jacket uses a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and requests an appropriate apology sentence through the OpenAI API, spoken aloud using speech API. A light bump triggers a brief response, while a stronger impact produces a more dramatic one. During the short delay before the AI replies, the jacket announces: “One moment please, I’m thinking about the best way to apologize properly.” This added delay injects humor and emphasizes the use of the machine.

The project highlights how instinctive and mechanical apologies can be in everyday life, especially in crowded spaces. By outsourcing this small but intimate social gesture to a machine, *Apology Jacket* exaggerates and critiques our growing reliance on AI, even for reflexive acts of politeness. The result is humorous, slightly unsettling, and reflective of how easily social behavior can be automated.

Making the pressure sensors by hand—cutting velostat, layering conductive fabric, and sewing them into the jacket—created a meaningful tension between slow, physical craft and rapid algorithmic automation. The irregularity of the handmade sensors directly influenced how the jacket behaved. Even small stitching decisions affected sensitivity and detection. The final outcome felt like a collaboration between the textile materiality and the digital logic.

Ultimately, *Apology Jacket* imagines a future where AI infiltrates even the smallest acts of etiquette. If our apologies can be automated, what other parts of human interaction might follow? The project playfully questions what we gain and what we lose when machines begin to speak for us.

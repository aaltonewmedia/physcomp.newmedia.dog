The idea I have in my project is based on digitalization of my previous project from my bachelor, the board game called "Bargain's Alchemy". The game's idea is to create a loop of potion creation and selling it to earn money as the final goal.

My desire is to combine physical cards from the game and create a direct connection with the digital version.

My main aims in this project are:

* Create a software and tag system that is able to recognize cards upon being scanned

* Be able to combine different cards to create "potion making mechanic", where ingredients correlate with physical cards

* Store created potion in a new "potion card" to view after

* To be able to "sell potions" and wiping off the "potion" card to restart the game system

  As far as I am aware, it should be possible, and I already have most of the cards and visual prepared, which only leads to coding and physical computation aspects of the project. I believe it should be possible by combining both Physical Computation and Design computation projects together.

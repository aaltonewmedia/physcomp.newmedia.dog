Project idea

A kinetic sound sculpture within the bookshelf inviting moments of collective listening within the quiet library. The sound sculpture and performance explore the narratives stored in a bookshelf in non-verbal forms through material resonance.


Goals for Dec 2025:

* Explore different combinations of materials and movements and create a prototype
* Building the foundation of a working system that I can build from
* Understand the mechanism behind the movement and think deeper about how can it relate to the conceptual aspect
* Narrow down the materials and movement → which ones would I like to go deeper into

**Goal for this week!** 

Generate 12 shit ideas! 

**What to think about?** 

* Material of the bookshelf is wood - should the material of the sound sculpture be wood, or using the wooden shelf to amplify the sound?
* How can sound design encourage social interaction?
* Can a sound sculpture be both aesthetic and functional?
* Playing with constraints of the environment (library) 
* What is the functionality of a bookshelf, a public library? 

Ideas on how it would look like:

* concentric patterns
* listening to from a tube

**Sound sculpture**

* Exploring kinetic movements (rotational, oscillatory, vibrational, percussive, floating) with step motors, solenoids, etc.
* The sound sculpture will be in a library, so the sound will not be continuous 
  → program the sound sculpture to turn on at 8am, turn off at 8pm, and do an action once an hour, etc.

**Performance**

* Performing with the sound sculpture - connecting arduino/pico with Max
* (June 2026) Idea - the sound sculpture could be placed inside the bookshelf, and performing with it → activation of the bookshelf, it being alive?

**Initial list of parts and components you think you will need**

* step motor 
* solenoid

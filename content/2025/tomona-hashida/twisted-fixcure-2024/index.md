![  Graduation Project Independent production Duration: Duration: Sep 7, 2023 – Jan 10, 2024    CONCEPT   Furniture that ﬁnds function and charm in twists "Twisted Fixture" is a ﬁxture that twists and pulls together. I created a coﬀee table and ﬂoor lamp with these ﬁxtures as the focal point. The twisted silicone tubes form a spiral shape, pulling together at strong or delicate angles, becoming iconic ﬁxtures within the furniture. These twisted forms are seen as having a subtle eﬀect and simple charm, oﬀering a new context for twists—usually associated with negative impressions—within the living space.](_dsc2329-のコピー.jpg)

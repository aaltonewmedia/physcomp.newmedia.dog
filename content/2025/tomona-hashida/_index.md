Creative Theme

Growing up surrounded by the rich natural environment of the Shikoku Karst in Japan, I developed a strong interest in the relationship between nature and human life. 

My work explores themes of material aging and changes caused by human behavior, aiming to shift the perception from "deterioration" to "transformation" through product and interior design.

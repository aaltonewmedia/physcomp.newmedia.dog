## Idea

A pigeon robot that hops towards people to peck at them. The bird calms down when it is touched. When no people are near, it pecks at the ground. The robot would also make bird-like coos.

**List of (possible) components** 

* Motors
* Motion detector(s)
* Speaker
* Capacitive touch sensor?
* Frame

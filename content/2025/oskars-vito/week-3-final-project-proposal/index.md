# Idea:

I think that I want to create an electro-mechanic instrument using a combination of motors, resonant chambers as well as re-used items such as bottles and other things I can get my hands on to create different sounds. I would start with only one motor and try to add to the project as it goes on.

# Inspirations:

**Koka's beat machine Nr 1:**

*https://youtu.be/4Dk6UG7ZSY4?si=ZpfH3RoaSon28LL7*

### Functionality:

* I want to control motors (perhaps a fan or a valve as well) to create either rhythmic or melodic sounds
* Ability to control the instrument with a midi keyboard
* Being able to send midi info to the instrument to play premade compositions
* Having 3x different sound sources (motors turning, hitting or moving objects / if I manage then trying to make a bottle resonate from air movement too)

### Components:

* Motors - stepper, servo, push and pull solenoid and perhaps a fan for the bottles

# Idea:

I think that I want to create a electro-mechanic instrument using a combo of motors, resonant chambers as well as re-used items such as bottles and other things I can get my hands on.



## Functionality:

* I want to control motors to create either rhythmic or melodic sounds
* Ability to control the instrument with a midi keyboard
* Being able to send midi info to the instrument to play premade compositions

Where have we left off? Oh right, from my last episode, I couldn't decide which final project proposal should I go for. Well, In the end I just kind of merge them both in a one final project. 

Drumroll please........... incoming, "The Weather Loom"!

So I still maintain the idea of the missing of places and friends and connecting with them through weather but by a textile and craftsmanship approach.

My initial idea was to build a new mechanical tool that allow the weaving textile to move according to the weather API, The physicality of it is challenging because this world have gravity, friction, force and what not, something that doesn't come naturally to me when sketching the prototype. I almost gave up but later realized that I purchase an old weaving loom from recycling center in summer and I can 'hack' it in a way that serve my purpose.

Then incoming the physical computing part. Software will betray you once a say but Hardware will betray you every 5 minutes or so (or that is probably because I just learn everything about it this class) so debugging sensor, port, connection, wifi, osc, etc. was a tug of war game but I actually enjoy doing it and I'm actually proud that I tried to debug and do most of the thing by myself first and if it's too hard to solve then I'll blink twice for Matti to help. Here is the picture of Matti holding mini switch for me, we called this Matti's tortured machine.

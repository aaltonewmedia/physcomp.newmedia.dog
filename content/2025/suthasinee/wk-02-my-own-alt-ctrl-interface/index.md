All the sensors we tested in the class are cool but I like 

1. APDS-9960 (Prox / Gesture / Color) and 

2. Capacitive Touch Sensor in particular

because it looks related to the interest i have more or less.

**APDS-9960 (Prox / Gesture / Color)**, as mentioned by Matti, the **gesture** is not very reliable but i find it useful more or less if we can filter properly. (It gives >, <, v, ^ as an output data). The color **detection** tell us R, G, B, and clear values from 0-255 but again, it's not very accurate and rely on the color reflection to the sensor. The **proximity** work as one would, i dont know what more to say.... (it gives values depends on how close or far you are from the sensor).

**Capacitive Touch Sensor** have 1-12 sensors that detect the capacity, it also works better when your computer is connected to power plug because of the ground cable thingy (that's not very exactly how it works but it's my way of understanding). there are many useful example that can detect the change value of each sensor, or simply tell you which snesor is being touched and release, etc.

The sensor could be attach to anything in the whole wide world, but i plan to attach it to textile and yarns. I have my own weaving loom that i picked up from 2nd hand store and thinking of doing something with it. If it can react to every thread being weaved or the pattern being created. It would be cool to detect colors from it and have something happen according to the rgb value, but it could be tricky.... we will see.



For the game, I immediately think of this one classic game (i don't remember the name by heart but i hope everyone recognise) the one when u touch each keyboard note kinda thing (picture attached) or making music from weaving loom somehow.



I will come back to this.....

Hi This is my first week's homework.

🤔 At begnnig I faced some problems for logic understanding, I thought buttons in Arduino/Rasperry circuit are similliar with buttons in physical circuit, they should control whether the circuit is closed. If I used the same logic for homework, then I realized it doesn't work.

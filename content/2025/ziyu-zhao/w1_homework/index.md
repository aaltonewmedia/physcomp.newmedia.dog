Hi This is my first week's homework.

🤔 At begnnig I faced some problems for logic understanding, I thought buttons in Arduino/Rasperry circuit are similliar with buttons in physical circuit, they should control whether the circuit is closed. If I used the same logic for homework, then I realized it doesn't work. So I search online to understand the principle of how button be used in Arduino.

I studied the use of botton is for utilizing the voltage difference to give signal through input pin, to control whether other pin ports output voltage.  And I also try to figure out the principle of Pull_up resistors and Pull_down resistors.

As a visual designer, my background lies more in the way things look, over the way that they might function. That being said, much of the terminology in this text was unfamiliar to me upon reading it for the first time, but proved to be very complementary to the topics covered so far during this course.

As highlighted by Hornecker, tangible interaction is a way to bridge the digital to the physical, with an emphasis on artefacts, environments or bodily interaction. In TI, the primarily focus is thus placed on the design of the interaction itself over the interface. The two are in no way to be thought of as separate entities, though, but something that is interconnected. 

In light of preparing my project proposal, I found it interesting to question whether the way that something might look can inspire bodily interaction (beyond thinking alone). Keeping this in mind, perhaps there is something to be considered in my own design practice–is there room for a more immersive way of experiencing visual communication design, beyond looking and reading?

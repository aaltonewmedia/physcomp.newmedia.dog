#### Assignment 1

*Find one interesting project/controller and write a short description of the project. Include a link to it and even embed a video to your site if it is available. Why did you choose this? What caught your attention?*

TIC TAC TOE THING (TTTT) by Shuang Cai

This project is an elegant take on a classic (archaic, even) game with new game tactics. As much as the beauty of this game may lie on its simple mechanism, I think half of the enjoyment is also due to its refined design and choice of materials. Almost architectural in its form, I think Cai’s project is particularly interesting through its sculptural approach to electronics, which is something I may also wish to explore in my final project during this course.

#### Assignment 2

*Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface*

* *Explore at least one sensor in more detail. You can do this with the actual sensor or just do some research on what is available in general.*
* *If you have access to the sensor, figure out how to read the values from it with your Arduino. Print out the data from the sensor to the Serial Monitor or Serial Plotter.*
* *If you are not able to actually use it, find out what type of data you can get out of it. Is it on/off signal, continuous number, some more complex data?*
* *Think of different interactions and/or gestures that could be detected with the sensor you picked. What kind of objects could the sensor be attached to?*
* *Choose an existing video game that could be controlled using the interaction/interface enabled by this sensor OR come up with a completely new game or game mechanic.*
* *You don’t need to make it work yet. Just come up with the idea/concept for your alternative controller.*
* *Write about your idea on your site.*
* *You can draw sketches or other ways to illustrate your idea.*
* *You can also make a prototype if you are able to, but I am not requiring it. It’s enough to just describe the concept.*
* *These can be silly, experimental, ridiculous, absurd…*

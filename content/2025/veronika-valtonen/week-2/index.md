TIC TAC TOE THING (TTTT) by Shuang Cai

This project is an elegant take on a classic (archaic, even) game with new game tactics. As much as the beauty of this game may lie on its simple mechanism, I think half of the enjoyment is also due to its refined design and choice of materials. Almost architectural in its form, I think Cai’s project is particularly interesting through its sculptural approach to electronics, which is something I may also wish to explore in my final project during this course.

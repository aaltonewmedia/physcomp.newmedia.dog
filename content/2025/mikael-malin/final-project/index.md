**First draft**

For the final project of the course, I want to do some early experimentations for the artistic component of my thesis.

In my thesis I look into how media archeological methods can be used to remediate a prehistoric technology into media art. The artistic component is a remediation of a tablet woven belt, a reimagined hybrid of old and new media. I want to explore the tablet woven belt as a medium of communication and technology of information storage and distribution. 

I don’t intend my course project to be ‘version 1’ of my thesis project, rather I want to use this chance to experiment with adding components to a tablet belt and (potentially) making it a circuit.

**Interaction**

The first idea I had was to use conductive yarn to see how it works with this weaving method. I wonder If I could achieve some difference in input by touching the belt in different spots.

The other idea is to somehow integrate some sensors in the weaving process itself.

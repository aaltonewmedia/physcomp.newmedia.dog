**1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface** 

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1znPs5sDTlo>

Immortal Funk Games’ Kneedle Drop is a rhythm game, where the player ”knits” with special alt-controls that resemble knitting needles. The game is one of the 2025 alt.ctrl.GDC finalists.

The knitting needle controls are delightful, and I like the simple motions that resemble how a child play-knits. The motions correspond to real stitches: you knit by crossing the needles and purl by crossing them the other way. Additionally there is push motion where you press the button on the tip of the needle, and slide where you pull the needle. For me push and slide feel a little clunky, I think they would easily take me out of the rhythm. I personally would have omitted the extra buttons on the controls, and instead explored different positions of the needles or perhaps pulling the yarn attached to them.

I’m not sure if the music on the video is also the background music of the game, but I really like the folk music paired with the  medieval-esque visuals on the screen. The happy tavern dance party vibe both fits the aesthetic of knitting and also gives the game the energy a rhythm game needs.

**2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface**

**RukkiParkki — Park your Spinning Wheel**

The most irritating parking experience ever is here!

I recently purchased an old spinning wheel from a recycling center. It’s lovely — but where will I put it? Where does it fit? RukkiParkki to the rescue: in this alt+ctrl game where you need to park your spinning wheel into various tight spaces. 

The spinning wheel works as an alternative control, and you operate it like a vehicle. You pedal to move back and forth, and turn left and right by twisting the handle. A projector projects the borders of a parking space on the floor, and simulates the movement by turning and moving the space when you steer your vehicle.

Sensors:

The wheel has an accelerometer attached to it: by sensing the changes in the pivot of the wheel the game can read the distance moved, and if the movement is forward or back. This should be pretty simple to code with only one axis.

The left-right controls: The spinning wheel has many parts that could work for left-right controls. I wanted to come up with a solution that minimises the damage to the spinning wheel in case of road rage. I will place a hard cardboard cylinder over one of  the vertical holders of the spool, to work as a handle you can twist left or right. The handle also has an accelerometer to sense if it’s turned left or right.

Possible problem: The cord attached to the sensors will get tangled when the wheel is spinned. 

Possible solution: Either some wireless solution, or attaching the sensor on the wooden peg connecting the pedal to the wheel (liipotin in Finnish), so that the sensor will retain its position when it moves in a circle. I’m unsure if I can still get data to read if the sensor doesn’t change its pivot, only position. To be tested.

For safety reasons the spool with the sharp spikes will be removed, to save the player from the fate of Sleeping Beauty forever parallel parking in her dreams.

It’s notably difficult to spin a spinning wheel slowly, especially for a beginner (which I am). Getting into the parking space requires a lot of finesse. This game is not for those with weak patience, but after you succeed, parallel parking with a car will no longer be an issue!

Disclaimer: I do not have a driver’s license, so all the critique about parking lot realism can be mailed to my home office where my cat files it for further processing.

I’ve always been fascinated by touch, it is our most direct connection to the world, yet often the most neglected sense. During my research, I encountered patients with tactile agnosia. They can see and hear, but struggle to truly *feel* the intensity or meaning of touch. It made me wonder: when the body can no longer express emotion, how might we relearn the language of touch?

I created a responsive sofa that reacts to a handshake. When a user holds its armrest, pressure sensors capture the grip intensity, while an algorithm analyzes whether the touch is too firm or too weak. The sofa then adjusts its physical form through motorized mechanisms, feeding the response back to the body. 

I chose furniture as the medium, embedding pressure sensors in the armrest, to introduce the idea of touch in a subtle way. Rather than a medical device, I wanted it to appear as nothing more than an ordinary sofa(something that belongs to daily life), so people can naturally lean on.

This approach also follows a kind of unconscious design. I didn’t want patients to be constantly reminded of their condition, instead, I wanted them to reconnect with their own bodies through everyday action.

The current version remains in a theoretical and technical stage, feels quiet and rational, more like a therapeutic tool. My next step is to give it more vitality and playfulness, turning tactile learning into an engaging, interactive experience rather than mere rehabilitation.

**Input:**

pressure sensor - the strength of handshake

**Output:**

air pump - cushion hardness

rotating module - backrest angle

lifting rod - seat height

sliding track - seat depth

### **Future Iterations**

**Inspiration**：https://shakethatbutton.com/yogaie/

To bring more emotional resonance into the experience, I want to introduce a projection system: A fireplace, the state of the firelight is controlled by the force of the handshake.

**1. Initial State** 

Sofa: Neutral form. 

Fireplace: The screen is dim, with faint embers flickering in the dark. 

Sound: A cool, distant wind fills the silence.

**2. Grip Too Weak** 

Sofa: Slightly rigid, unresponsive. 

Fireplace: Embers remain dull, with almost no change. 

Sound: The cold wind continues.

**3. Grip Too Strong** 

Sofa: Compressed shape, creating gentle resistance. 

Fireplace: Embers flare up suddenly, then *“puff”* out, leaving a trace of smoke. 

Sound: A brief burst of flame followed by silence.

**4. “Just Right” Grip** 

Sofa: Soft, balanced, responsive. 

Fireplace: The embers awaken, flames rise slowly, and the space fills with warm light. 

Sound: The soft “crackle” of fire.

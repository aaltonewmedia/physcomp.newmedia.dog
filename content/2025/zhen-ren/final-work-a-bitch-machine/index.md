## When Language Warps / A Bitch Machine

![](img_6425.jpg)

This project is officially called When Language Warps, but I usually just call it the Bitch Machine.

### Introduction:

It is an interactive installation that reveals how environments response to what we say.

The system shifts its persona between three “bitch modes”, according to ambient light and sound, responding to the user’s input with intentional malice and bias. It works like an environment translator—once a sentence leaves us, it gets reshaped by the environment’s emotions, biases, and attitudes.

It reflects a growing reality: we are becoming accustomed to a world that answers us with prejudice—and increasingly numb to that prejudice itself. Over time, we get used to hostile or twisted responses, We start to go quiet, and only say things that feel “safe enough” for the environment.



### How It works:

The whole system runs as a loop:

the environment pushes → you get irritated → you respond → the environment magnify  the hostility → you react again → and everything keeps escalating.

After each interaction, the system prints a backend log based on the current environmental state. The receipt allows the audience to see details such as the Bitch Mode, Bias Style, and Pressure Tone.

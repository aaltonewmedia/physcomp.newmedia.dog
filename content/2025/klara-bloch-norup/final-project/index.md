KNITTED SURFACES

in collaboration with knit designer, Lila Monin, I will work with knitted fabrics as the interface

we are working with conductive yarn and wool as the main materials and we will combine machine knit with hand knit

CREATING SOUND

we are interested in sound the feedback of the interaction

and we are at the moment questioning how to implementing it and who to collaborate with

AND POTENTIALLY LIGHT 

I am interesting in light too

it is essential for the atmosphere and I enjoy making lamps, so I might be able to include that in a way

for now I have made a prototype of a knitted lamp, but how to take it further into the project is something I am questioning

open for inputs, ideas and collaborations, please send an email to klara.bloch-norup@aalto.fi and I'll get back to you within a few business days

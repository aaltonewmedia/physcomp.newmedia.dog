## 1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface

I like the simplicity and tactility of this piece. It uses a familiar and simple game into a tactile box.

I also really enjoyed Matti's tactile sound piece. Again, I like the simplicity of interface. I also really enjoyed that the interface is wooden and that it involves a collection of interesting sounds.

## 2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface

One sensor I'm interested in is the wind sensor (anemometer). I would like to use it to detect the wind or the air user is blowing into the sensor. I believe the data from the sensor would be continuous.

I am also interested in NFC tags, even though I'm not sure if it's called a sensor. I believe the tags would cause binary output. 

## 3. Complete the MyCourses introductions for the 3D Printing and Laser Cutter workshops

\* laser cutter workshop: done.

\* 3d printing workshop: in progress.

## 1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface

I like the simplicity and tactility of this piece. It uses a familiar and simple game into a tactile box.

I also really enjoyed Matti's tactile sound piece. Again, I like the simplicity of interface. I also really enjoyed that the interface is wooden and that it involves a collection of interesting sounds.

## 2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface

Sensors I'm interested in:

1. wind sensor (anemometer) - I would like to use it to detect the wind or the air user is blowing into the sensor. I believe the data from the sensor would be continuous.

2. NFC (Near Field Communication) tags - It would be interesting to use NFC tags to trigger sounds. I believe the tags would cause binary output. 

3. Temperature sensor - I enjoy the idea of sensing warmth (and life) using temperature sensor. I believe the temperature sensor data would be continuous.

## 3. Complete the MyCourses introductions for the 3D Printing and Laser Cutter workshops

\* laser cutter workshop: done.

\* 3d printing workshop: in progress.

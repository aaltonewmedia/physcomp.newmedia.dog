**First Arduino Work
INSTRUCTION**
Create a circuit and Arduino code that does the following

**Circuit #**
Connect two LEDs to your Arduino using a breadboard
Connect one switch to your Arduino using a breadboard
**Code #**
Read a momentary switch being pressed
When the program starts, both LEDs are off
When the switch is pressed once, the first LED turns on
When the switch is pressed the second time, the second LED turns on (the first one should also still be on)
When the switch is pressed the third time, both LEDs turn off
Repeat this same cycle of LEDs turning on and off in sequence (off, one LED, two LEDs, offâ€¦)

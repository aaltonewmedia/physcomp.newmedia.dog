**Destined Place**

**Overview**

This is an **Interactive Installation** designed for my friend's Capstone Project - **Poloris Conceptual Chocolate Store**. Poloris is a unique chocolate brand created by my friend, characterized by its innovative combination of travel and chocolate. The brand not only offers emotional value to customers but also encourages them to explore and visit new destinations while collecting chocolates from various cities.

Within the store, there is an experiential interactive installation. According to my friend's original design, its primary function is to provide customers with detailed chocolate-related information, such as origin, flavor profiles, and farm details. Additionally, it offers travel tips and recommendations related to the corresponding countries associated with the chocolates. Moreover, if customers have a specific flavor in mind, the installation can also guide them to the exact location of the desired chocolate within the store.



**Thinking Process**

When I first encountered this interactive installation, my initial reaction was that its potential should extend beyond mere navigation from an **experience design perspective**. Considering the overall atmosphere and design keywords of the Poloris chocolate store, customers are likely seeking more than functional or rational design—they’re looking for surprises and moments of delight that can’t be found in other stores.

The store features elements such as the **Aurora Borealis**, a **flat map of the Earth**, and a **logo resembling a celestial chart**. Taking these into account, I identified the aesthetic direction for the entire project, drawing inspiration from these unique design cues.

I also applied a bit of reverse thinking here: typically, customers visit a city first and then purchase souvenirs from that city (in this case, chocolate). However, I believe a more romantic approach would be to inspire customers to develop an interest in a city *because* of a piece of chocolate—planting the idea of “I want to travel there” in their minds.

Introduction:\
What is Life? If a liquid metal droplet can eat and digest aluminum, obtaining energy for its own movement; can play with companions, or even have personalities such as shyness, curiosity, brightness and naughty, is it alive?

MetaLife is a series of interactive installations, representing different "personalities" of liquid metal "mollusks".

My concept:\
\
Sensor: Accelerometer+Gyroscope+Gravity？

I want to design a simple boxing game that uses a wearable device on the wrist to detect the hand’s movement direction and speed for scoring. The game tracks the player’s movements in real time based on sensor data, including movement direction and speed, and provides instant feedback in different modes. This design enhances interactivity and allows players to enjoy the fun and sense of achievement that come with improving their speed and accuracy through continuous practice.

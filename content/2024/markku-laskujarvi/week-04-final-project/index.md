My final project idea is to make multiplayer game with single button controllers derived out of one USB SNES knockoff controller, that has multiple sensors attached to the controls. I will develop a FPS game for it.



UPDATE 12112024:

I came up with a further idea that would have a viewfinder for looking around and a stress ball or similar thing to recognize squeezing, to grab or interact with objects in the FPS world. For the feet, footpedals or buttons would trigger footsteps to walk forward, while pressing down both feet would make the player jump.

As I presented my idea I received many good ideas to develop the controller and game experience better. Matti mentioned that all sensors should be readily available, in theory at least. The shape of the squeeze controller should have at least one flat side to be easily detected by the pressure sensor. Matti also mentioned the possibility to use conductive fabric to create a more sophisticated controller.

As Matti pointed out, the game itself is not that fleshed out. This is a usual problem for me, as I enjoy more making control systems than content. Heya suggested the game could have a milk-related theme of making cheese cubes from milk you would squeeze out of a cow's udders. This made me think of a sort of puzzle-game where the player is a gnome escaping the cow house.

Apurv was wondering if it is an FPS controller, why is there no shooting. I personally am bored of first-person games that focus on shooting so i decided to go with something else, more puzzle-oriented perhaps.

Fiona pointed out that an existing game could be controlled, and if keyboard keys and mouse movement could be triggered with the controller, that would cut alot of trouble and work. The game engine is also still a question, perhaps I will use Blender if the keyboard control works out, if not, I will use TouchDesigner.

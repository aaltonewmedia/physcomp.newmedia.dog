**Introduction**

Hoki is an AI-powered nurturing pet designed for young, high-end consumers. It caters specifically to young adults living independently in big cities who lack emotional interaction, offering emotional comfort and interactive support. By integrating technologies such as voice interaction, motion interaction, and emotional simulation, the product leverages hardware sensors and local AI capabilities to deliver personalized, multidimensional emotional companionship. It is suitable for scenarios such as leisure and entertainment, fitness assistance, household chores, and daily commuting.

INSTRUCTURE:

Read a momentary switch being pressed

When the program starts, both LEDs are off

When the switch is pressed once, the first LED turns on

When the switch is pressed the second time, the second LED turns on (the first one should also still be on)

When the switch is pressed the third time, both LEDs turn off

Repeat this same cycle of LEDs turning on and off in sequence (off, one LED, two LEDs, offâ€¦)

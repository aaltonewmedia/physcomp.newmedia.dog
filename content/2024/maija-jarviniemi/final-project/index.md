## **Project proposal guidelines:**

*Create a project proposal for your final project. Think of this as a constantly evolving document where you take notes on your final project ideas.* 

* *Some short thoughts on what you would like to explore and work with conceptually and technically. What is it that you want to make? How does it look like? What does it do?*
* *Some references (artworks/projects that are similar to what you would like to do)*
* *Initial list of parts and components you think you will need*

## **Here we go!**

**Starting point:**

\- I am expanding my project I presented in  Computation A&D course on Fri 8th of Nov, link to [the Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLIm3lwU=/).

\- In **p5.js** I am planning to do **drawing exercises on spirals and other circular paths** inspired by old *special figure skating* figures as well as beautifully illustrated instruction patterns of old ballroom dances

\- **In Physical Computing** I aim to focus on creating **a user interface** that enables interaction with the drawing exercises

**What kind of interaction and UI?**

OPTION 1: 

\- fyysinen säädin, potikka -> pyörittävä liike jolla säädellään kuviota

\- kuvat piirtyy näytölle? tms

OPTION 2:

\- projektori seinällä/katossa

\- arduino+sensori tunnistaa liikkeet/askeleet 

\- kuviot piirtyy lattiaan/seinälle liikkeen/askeleiden mukaisesti

**Parts and components needed:**

For OPTION 1: 

* Arduino
* Potentiometer(s)
* Perhaps a button

For OPTION 2: 

* Arduino
* A sensor for detecting movement --> LOOK INTO THIS
* A projector

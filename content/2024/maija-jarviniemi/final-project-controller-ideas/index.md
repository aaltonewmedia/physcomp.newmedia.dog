### 19.11.2024 Things to consider

Here's a sensor that might work with this kind of spiral slider: [https://learn.bela.io/products/trill/about-trill/](<>)

* Matti told that the spiral could be cut from **copper sticker in Fablab** -> they have a suitable material for the vinyl cutter
* **3d model** for the top part but also for the wiring etc beneath:

  * Rounded edge for the spiral for soft touch
  * What's the size of the controller? 
  * The thickness/depth of the "furrow" (ura in Finnish)?
  * Is there some kind of structure inside for the wiring? How are the top and bottom part attached? 
  * A 3d printed bottom layer for the copper sticker to put on, is it just a square/circle or a spiral as well? To ease the wiring?
* For the spiral:

  * How much margin/saumavara for the wires if they are soldered on the sides of the spiral
  * **In how many sections should the spiral be cut?** 30 was the number in one the Bela sensors
  * How to fit the spiral perfectly with the 3d printed top part? 
* For now I think the controller will be connected to the computer with usb-c cable where it will also get power from -> in the future version it would need batteries
* Figure out how to **connect the data** from the sensor with **p5.js**

### The Trill Ring sensor

For the sensor to work, it needed two pull-up resistors between SCL + 5 v and SDA + 5v. Prior the custom spiral sensor, I am going to use a Trill ring sensor with the same slider capacities.

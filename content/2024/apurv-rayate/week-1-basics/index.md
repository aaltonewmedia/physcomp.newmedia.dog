## Physical Computing Exercise

Create a circuit and Arduino code that does the following

#### Circuit  
Connect two LEDs to your Arduino using a breadboard  
Connect one switch to your Arduino using a breadboard  

#### Code

Read a momentary switch being pressed  
When the program starts, both LEDs are off  
When the switch is pressed once, the first LED turns on  
When the switch is pressed the second time, the second LED turns on (the first one should also still be on)  
When the switch is pressed the third time, both LEDs turn off  
Repeat this same cycle of LEDs turning on and off in sequence (off, one LED, two LEDs, offâ€¦)

**Both** LEDs are **OFF**.

---

![One LED ON](/assets/images/one_on.jpg)

**One** LED is **ON**.

---

![Both LEDs ON](/assets/images/both_on.jpg)

**Both** LEDs are **ON**.

#### Reflection

The three cases listed in the assignment are demonstrated above. I followed a similar process to how we read LED input in class. For the circuit, I added another LED on pin 11 to the my circuit from class. For the code, I added a state variable that determines which of the three required states the circuit should be in. Finally I added a delay to smoothen the transition between two different states so that there were no jitters in reading the button input.

Here is my code attached:

    int ledPin1 = 9;
    int ledPin2 = 11;
    int btnPin = 2;
    int btnVal = 0;
    int state = 0;

    void setup() {
      // put your setup code here, to run once:
      pinMode(ledPin1, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(btnPin, INPUT);
      Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
      // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
      btnVal = digitalRead(btnPin);

      if(btnVal == HIGH){
        state++;
        if(state >= 3){
          state = 0;
        }
        delay(200);
      }

      if(state==0){
        digitalWrite(ledPin1, LOW);
        digitalWrite(ledPin2,LOW);
      }else if(state==1){
        digitalWrite(ledPin1, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(ledPin2,LOW);
      }else{
        //digitalWrite(ledPin1, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(ledPin2,HIGH);
      }

      Serial.println(state);

      delay(10);

    }

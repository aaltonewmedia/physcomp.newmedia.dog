## Final Project

## Proposal

#### What are you making?

I am making a fish photography game called PhotoCrit for my Computational Art and Design project. You take pictures of critically endangered fish as part of a conservation effort. You learn more about these species and what is leading to their extinction. For physical computing, I will be making a polaroid camera that links to the game. The player can take pictures of the fish in the game and get real-time prints of the pictures they took.

#### Images/Inspiration  
**1. What the game might look like**
![fotoquest](foto.jpg)
Fotoquest fishing is an old java game from 2006 that was also a fish photography game.  
![insaniquarium](insani.jpg)
Insaniquarium is an old game from 2001 that looks similar to what I am making.
  
**2. What the camera might look like**
![cam1](bfvg.jpg)
![cam2](fdgs.jpg)
I will model the pcomp project based on a polaroid camera. I might 3d print the camera chassis. It is important to note that while this project will look like a camera, it is functionally a printer. My main task will be to convert the image from the game into data that the Arduino and the thermal printer can read and then have it printed either wirelessly or through a physical connection.

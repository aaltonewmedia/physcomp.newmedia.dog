Feature: Duck from Matti and my baby mango :)

Background: An AIGC work, I like it

**1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface**

"Puppet Master"

Description: This is a game that users can control the puppet in the game scenario. But! This is not a game that we need to lead the character to the victory. The goal in this game is make your puppet suffering in limited time, the puppet suffer more, player will get highter score. Players would hold a teddy bear toy and control bear's legs to make puppet move. 

Reason I chose this: Firstly, the way to manipulate the character(the puppet) is very attractive for me. It is a teddy bear which is so cute, but mean while player control this cute bear to torture the puppet. It creates a strong sense of contrast, which I think is very novel. Secondly, Teddy bears and puppets are also related and similar. Controlling a teddy bear with limbs to destroy and self-harm is more realistic than controlling a game character with a controller.

**2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface**

**Sensor: Temperature and Humidity Sensor | AHT20**

**如果您可以访问传感器，请弄清楚如何使用 Arduino 读取传感器的值。将传感器的数据打印到串行监视器或串行绘图仪。**

**想想你选择的传感器可以检测到哪些不同的交互和/或手势。传感器可以连接到哪种物体上？**

**透气性强，因为我发现这个传感器必须非常靠近才能检测到温度和湿度的变化。**

**但同时我认为将传感器直接暴露在外有点不合时宜，所以材料的选择非常重要**





**Warm Moomin**

**Description:** 作品由一个包裹着传感器的毛绒小球/毛绒小moomin和屏幕组成，人们通过握住/朝小球哈气，可以提升温度和湿度来影响屏幕中火堆的强弱，以让屏幕中取火的姆明更加暖和。如果温度逐渐降低，moomin会感到寒冷最终冻成冰块。让大家来温暖moomin吧！

Moomin is sooooo cute, nobody wants to let him frozen, right?

Of course I will change the character if I decide to make this game complete, because I don't want to be sued by company. 

Short-distance interaction(0-40cm)

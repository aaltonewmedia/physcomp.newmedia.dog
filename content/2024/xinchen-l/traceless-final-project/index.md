**Conc﻿ept:**

In this project, we aim to use ice as a medium and collaborate with ice, focusing on the transformative qualities of its melting process to reveal the active roles that objects play in shaping our environment.

Historically, ice has embodied contrasting qualities—during the Anthropocene, it is often characterized as fragile and receding (Carey, 2007), yet in the age of glaciers, it was a formidable force capable of overwhelming human existence. Ice itself embodies tension: it is adhesive yet slick, seemingly clear yet opaque, solid yet delicate, enduring yet vulnerable to time’s pressures (Rider, 2019).

By observing and amplifying the visual and auditory changes as ice melts, we draw attention to the interaction between two contrasting temporal scales: the slow, expansive time of Earth’s geological history and the accelerated, urgent pace of glacial melt due to human activity. We aim to depict a de-anthropocentric future, shifting our perspective to understand how human intervention has expedited natural processes and altered environmental rhythms.

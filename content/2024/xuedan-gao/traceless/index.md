Traceless is an interactive sound sculpture with visual projections. It invites audiences to engage with its narrative through handheld controllers. The project centers on ice as both a medium and a collaborator, exploring its transformative qualities during the melting process to highlight the active ï»¿role of nonhuman entities in shaping our environment.

Ice has historically embodied dualities: during the Anthropocene, it symbolized fragility and retreat, yet in the age of glaciers, it wielded immense power, dwarfing human existence. By amplifying the visual and auditory shifts as the ice melts, the project contrasts two temporal scales: the slow, expansive timeline of glacial formation and the rapid, human-accelerated pace of their current retreat. Traceless envisions a de-anthropocentric future, inviting audiences to reconsider how human intervention has reshaped natural processes.

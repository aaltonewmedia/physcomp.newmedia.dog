*Traceless* is an interactive sound sculpture with visual projections. It invites audiences to engage with its narrative through handheld controllers. The project centers on ice as both a medium and a collaborator, exploring its transformative qualities during the melting process to show the active ï»¿role of nonhuman entities in shaping our environment.

Ice has historically embodied dualities: during the Anthropocene, it symbolized fragility and retreat, yet in the age of glaciers, it wielded immense power, dwarfing human existence. By amplifying the visual and auditory shifts as the ice melts, the project contrasts two temporal scales: the slow, expansive timeline of glacial formation and the rapid, human-accelerated pace of their current retreat. *Traceless* envisions a de-anthropocentric future, inviting audiences to reconsider how human intervention has reshaped natural processes.

## Background

### Glacial Ice Formation

* Snow gradually compresses into ice as layers build up annually 
* Over time, it recrystallizes into firn, an intermediate state, and eventually becomes dense glacier ice. This process, which can take over a century, forms large ice crystals with minimal air pockets

### Glacier Melting

Glacier melting rapidly in the past two centuries is driven by:

* Fossil fuel combustion: CO2 and methane emissions causing global warming
* Deforestation: Reduced carbon absorption capacity
* Urbanization & agriculture
* Industrialization

## Installation

Our installation consists of a main body and 7 stone-shaped controllers. The main body is made of 0.5mm steel rods, with a block of ice on top. The ice melts into a 3D-printed funnel, and water drips onto a metal plate at the bottom. The controller is 3D printed using PLA with fiber material.

## Interaction Design

* The behavior of humans does not control the process of ice;  
* The sounds people make can merge with the sounds of ice to form an echo;
* Humans cannot intervene, and any change will be embraced within the echo of the natural system.

### Content of Interaction

* The main body is natural ice melting and dripping to create an overall ambient sound;
* A human holds the controller distributed around the main body and gets visual (led) and audio (musical note) feedback;
* The human creates sound against the sensor (small microphone), and the sound blends and reverberates with the sound of falling water drops;
* When each sensor receives touch from a human, the visual projected behind it goes from snowflake to glacier.

## Visual Design

In terms of visual design, we used snowflakes to represent the process of glacier formation and a dataset of glacier monthly melting areas in Greenland in recent decades to represent the impact of human activities on natural rhythms.

### Snowflake

In p5.js, we create a basic linear model to visualize the evolving structure of a snowflake crystal, showcasing its transformation dynamically over time. Then, we integrate this with TouchDesigner by adding a particle effect background. We then overlay these particle effects onto the transforming snowflake structure. Finally, we implement audio-visual interaction to synchronize the visual transformations and particle effects with sound, creating an engaging and interactive experience.

### Glacier

We generated an AI-driven glacier video using the Deforum extension of Stable Diffusion, showcasing an animated representation of glacier dynamics. To enhance the visualization, we utilized TouchDesigner for advanced visual effects processing, using techniques such as blob tracking. We also implemented audio-responsive changes, allowing the visual elements to react dynamically to sound, and developed data-driven visualizations to integrate scientific information into the artistic narrative. For the dataset, we used the Greenland Surface Melt Extent from the NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center), a reliable source of historical records. During the data processing stage, we converted the dataset into CSV format to facilitate analysis, focusing on extracting the monthly mean melting area of Greenland's surface from April to October over the period 1979 to 2024. This processed data was then integrated into the visuals, creating a data-informed depiction of environmental change.

## Sound Design

In terms of sound design, we tried to blend human voices into the echo of dripping water from melting ice. And when the audience interacts, every touch generates corresponding auditory feedback.

This project can be divided into an audio-based system and a MIDI-based system. For the audio-based system, we need to handle inputs from a total of 9 microphones. We used two AKG C411 contact condenser microphones placed under metal plates to capture the sound of melting ice droplets, along with 7 small microphones embedded in each controller. The signals from the contact microphones are fed into a raindrops effect processor and also into a multiband delay and reverb processor. The signals collected by the small microphones in each controller are sent to a harmonizer, which then feeds into the multiband delay and reverb processors. In terms of interaction, the touch data from the Arduino using a capacitive touch sensor was mapped to the parameters of the harmonizer.

## System Overview

This installation system combines hardware and software modules to achieve artistic expression through multi-level interaction. The sculpture contains a water pump, four LED lights and two contact microphones, which are used to control water flow, light and sound capture respectively, and are centrally managed by Arduino. We used a potentiometer to control the flow rate of the water pump and a button to control the switch of the LEDs. The controller module includes a capacitive touch sensor, 7 LED lights and 7 microphones for touch sensing and sound recording. Arduino, as the core control unit, receives sensor data from the sculpture and controller modules, transmits information to Max/MSP through serial communication, and controls the physical output of the device. The audio interface collects the microphone signal and passes it to Max/MSP, which further processes the data from the hardware and performs audio processing, and transmits the results to TouchDesigner through the OSC protocol. TouchDesigner generates real-time visual effects based on the input and presents them through projection.

## Reflection

The idea for this project began in March this year, when I began to think about how to work with ice in sound. The initial inspiration came from Annea Lockwood's work A Sound Map of the Danube. In her work, she used sounds from nature and used an equalizer to highlight only the frequencies she liked. This inspired me to create a work with ice as the theme, which would arouse thoughts on the relationship between nature and humans by amplifying the ignored sounds in our daily lives. Therefore, my initial idea was to record the sound of ice and try to keep the sound original without too much processing.

Later, I read an article about the anthropology of ice. The article explored the multiple meanings of ice: it was once an awe-inspiring natural force in history, but now it has become fragile and rapidly receding due to climate change. This prompted me to think: how to use art to contrast the slow process of ice formation with its current rapid melting, thereby showing the disruption of natural rhythms by human activities.

My initial idea was to record the sound of ice melting naturally and compare it with the sound of artificial accelerated melting (such as adding hot water) to reflect this conflict of rhythms. After discussing my idea with Xinchen, she suggested a more expressive approach: conveying the slow evolution of ice in time through the formation process of snowflakes, ice cubes, and glacial ice.

When trying to record the sound of ice, I experimented with various methods, including using XY recording, embedding contact microphones in ice cubes, and using funnels as amplification devices. But in the end, I decided to focus on recording the sound of dripping water as the ice melted. This natural and gradual process just reflects the rhythm of nature.

In the process of making the installation, I kept thinking about how to design it "more cleverly" and tried to give a reason for every decision I made, but I found that I tried to combine too many things together in the process, and sometimes I lost the focus, but I have to say that this made the work more logical. I think I should learn how to better balance intuition and logic in the future.

This collaboration with Xinchen has yielded unexpectedly remarkable results. I feel that our professional backgrounds have achieved a perfect complementarity. I've always aspired to create sound sculptures, and as someone oriented toward auditory experiences, I can envision the form of the installation but struggle to integrate it with more complex physical structures. Xinchen's expertise in installation and visual design is truly impressive, seamlessly blending sound and visual experiences.

During the exhibition, the randomness of audience interactions made me realize that the hardware system of the installation might need an upgrade to make it more robust. Additionally, wiring and arranging the cables poses a significant challenge. Moving forward, I want to find a smarter solution to enhance the hardware system.

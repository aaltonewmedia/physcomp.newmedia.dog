### 1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface

Hen is a remote-controlled egg boiler designed for a patient cooking experience. To use it, gently place an egg inside, add enough water to cover it, and secure the cap. Hold the controller carefully and wait—like a hen hatching her eggs, it requires time. Expect soft-boiled perfection in over two hours.

How it works?
- 3D printed boiler and remote control
- MKR WiFi 1010 board
- temperature sensor
- heat pad

I chose this project because I love the concept of boiling an egg and the comparison between a hen hatching her egg and humans cooking one. It attempts to view things from the animal’s point of view. Additionally, I love the remote-control feature for its simplicity and aesthetic appeal. A wired, more complex setup often takes extra time and effort to figure out how to hide the cables.

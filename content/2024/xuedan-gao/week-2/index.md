### 1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface

Hen is a remote-controlled egg boiler designed for a patient cooking experience. To use it, gently place an egg inside, add enough water to cover it, and secure the cap. Hold the controller carefully and wait—like a hen hatching her eggs, it requires time. Expect soft-boiled perfection in over two hours.

**How it works?**

* 3D-printed boiler and remote control
* MKR WiFi 1010 board
* temperature sensor
* heat pad

**Video:**

I chose this project because I love the concept of boiling an egg and the comparison between a hen hatching her egg and humans cooking one. It attempts to view things from the animal’s point of view. Additionally, I love the remote-control feature for its simplicity and aesthetic appeal. A wired, more complex setup often takes extra time and effort to figure out how to hide the cables.

### 2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface

 **Sensor: AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor**

**What kind of data can I get out of it?**

* **Temperature Data**

  * Range: -40 to 85 °C
  * Accuracy: ±0.3 °C typical accuracy at 20-60 °C; ±1 °C typical accuracy over the entire range
* **Humidity Data**

  * Range: 0% to 100% Relative Humidity (RH)
  * Accuracy: ±2% RH at 20-80% RH; ±3% typical accuracy over the full range
